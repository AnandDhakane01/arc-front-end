# ARC(Animal Rescue Community)

## Raising Hands For Injured Paws

ARC is a non-profit organization which helps orphan pets find their new homes and a family.

<!-- TODO: conplete this section -->
<!-- CodeWorkout was inspired by many great systems built by others, but aims to bring together the best from earlier forerunners while adding important new features.

It provides comprehensive support for teachers who want to use coding exercises in their courses, while also maintaining flexibility for self-paced learners who aren't part of an organized course. -->
